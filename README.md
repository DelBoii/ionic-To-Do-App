# ionicToDoApp

This app will implement and expand upon the basic to do app provided in Ionic tutorials.
Starting with a basic list with a tab for adding tasks, the app will be built out to include more features. I intend to have the app finished by the 24th of April.

At this present moment I am simply testing git functions to build an extensive commit history and use this project as a means to further my knowledge of git.

#### Plans for future additions:
* Reorder tasks in the list/ reorder parent lists
- Looking into adding Admob Banner
+ Adding due date to tasks
+ Adding radio buttons to tasks
+ Possibly login auth page
+ ~~Settings button in left corner~~
+ ~~Different add task button to free up space for a reorder button~~


####Update: 20th April:
Have changed design plan from a tabbed app to one with a side menu. Originally intending to have tabs and then a sidemenu. See this reflected on android made me decide against it.
Completly redesigned the app with several commits. Added tasks with delete options and a side menu containing parent lists.
Adding localStorage is next goal.
####Update: 21th April:
I have added a material design button in the app which will now control the addTask function. I had issues implementing the provided ionic fab button and made use of a solution on ionic forums.   https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/material-design-floating-action-button-z-index-problem/12234  
Added a settings button for future updates. Next on roadmap is a reorder tasks button.
