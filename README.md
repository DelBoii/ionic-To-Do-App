# ionicToDoApp

This app will implement and expand upon the basic to do app provided in Ionic tutorials.
Starting with a basic list with a tab for adding tasks, the app will be built out to include more features. I intend to have the app finished by the 24th of April.

At this present moment I am simply testing git functions to build an extensive commit history and use this project as a means to further my knowledge of git.

####Update: 20th April:
Have changed design plan from a tabbed app to one with a side menu. Originally intending to have tabs and then a sidemenu. See this reflected on android made me decide against it.
Completly redesigned the app with several commits. Added tasks with delete options and a side menu containing parent lists.
Adding localStorage is next goal.

#### Plans for future additions:
* Reorder tasks in the list/ reorder parent lists
- Looking into adding Admob Banner
+ Adding due date to tasks
+ Adding radio buttons to tasks
+ Possibly login auth page
+
