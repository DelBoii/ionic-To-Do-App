# ionicToDoApp

This app will implement and expand upon the basic to do app provided in Ionic tutorials.
Starting with a basic list with a tab for adding tasks, the app will be built out to include more features. I intend to have the app finished by the 24th of April.

At this present moment I am simply testing git functions to build an extensive commit history and use this project as a means to further my knowledge of git.

Update: 20th April:
Have changed design plan from a tabbed app to one with a side menu. Originally intending to have tabs and then a sidemenu. See this reflected on android made me decide against it.
Completly redesigned the app with several commits. Added tasks with delete options and a side menu containing parent lists.
Adding localStorage is next goal.  
Update 24th April:  
During development issues occured which caused the app not to function (22nd) this was not caught due to running in ionic serve consistantly. Resolved the errors by rolling back to a previous commit and adding in code again testing after each piece added on an Android phone. 
iOS Version is built in addition to android.  
  
Add task button in top right corner removed in place of material design button
